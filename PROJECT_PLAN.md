# 🧭 Project Management App – Blueprint

## 1. Why does this project exist?

To practice and combine fundamental and advanced React concepts (Components, State, Refs, Portals, and Styling) by building a small but functional Project Management App.

## 2. What should it do? (Core Features)

- Create new projects
- Add tasks to projects
- View different projects
- Clear (complete/delete) tasks
- Delete projects

## 3. Which React concepts will it involve?

- **Components**: Structuring the UI
- **State**: Managing project/task data
- **Refs**: Handling DOM or input interactions
- **Portals**: Managing modal or overlay components
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for layout & visuals

## 4. Where should the data live?

Local state (`useState`), Lifting State Up or Deriving state from props.

# 🧠 PROJECT PLAN
